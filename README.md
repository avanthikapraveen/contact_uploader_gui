# Contact Uploader Tool

This is a desktop tool that helps upload a large number of phone numbers from an Excel file to Google Contacts. It can also delete previously uploaded contacts based on area name.

## What It Does

- Reads phone numbers from an Excel (.xlsx) file.
- Uploads them to your Google Contacts.
- Saves each contact in the format: AreaName - PhoneNumber.
- Can delete previously uploaded contacts by matching area name.
